This software is provided for free by the [EDIMAX](http://www.edimax.com/edimax/global/) company. In fact, it's not provided aiming to work with TP-Link's hardware, but as the internal chip is the same, it works. I claim no copyright over EDIMAX software. The only reason I uploaded it here is to make it easier for others to find it.
